# Lists are in Order

"""
- A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we
do something to change the order.

- A list can be sorted (e.g, change its order)

-The sort method (unlike in strings) means 'sort yourself'

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
friends.sort()
print(friends)
# ['Glenn', 'Joseph', 'Sally']
print(friends[1])
# Joseph
