# Building a list from scratch

# We can create an empty list and then add elements using the append method

# The list stays in order and new elements are added at the end of the list

stuff = list() #constructor form -- to tell Python to make a list. Then assigned the list to the stuff
stuff.append('book')
stuff.append(99)
print(stuff)

stuff.append('cookie')
print(stuff)
