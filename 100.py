# The regular expression module

"""
- Before you can use regular expression in your program, you must import
the library using 'import re'.

- You can use re.search() to see if a string matches a regular expression,
similar to using the find() method for strings

- You can use re.findall() to extract portions of a string that match your
regular expression, similar to a combination of find() and slicing: var[5:10]
