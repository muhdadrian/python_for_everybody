# Using the range function

print(range(4))
# no. 4 will not included

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
print(len(friends))

print(range(len(friends)))


# The range function returns a list of numbers that range from zero to one less than the parameter.

# We can construct an index loop using for and an integer iterator.
